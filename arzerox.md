# Arzerox
Arzerox  is a bot developped by Kama#4725 in association with Cheater140#0037 .
You can remaster the code if you want to but you will not be able to just use it in your server if you don't know some proper things. [Check this part to know how](#remaster-the-code), else head [here](#how-to-add-to-your-server) for setup.

## How to add to your server.
Add the bot [using bitly](https://bit.ly/arzerox) or trough [direct link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=924958157023887400&scope=bot&permissions=8).
Run the ```
            +help
        ```
 and setup your commands.

## Remaster the code

Firstly, clone this repo. Then you will want to download the .zip with the files, extract and open the folder in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Now if you are on the [public repo](https://github.com/KamaDiscord/arzerox-public), you can just change the few settings that require [.env](#install-env), otherwise on the [private one](https://github.com/KamaDiscord/arzerox), you can modify as you wish, but you won't have access to private commands such as the [+gen](#atom-services)
